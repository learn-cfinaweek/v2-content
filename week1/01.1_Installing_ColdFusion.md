To be able to program in ColdFusion, a ColdFusion server needs to be
installed. There are a few options available for installing CF, ranging from the traditional full/gui installer, to the new zip install option (added in CF2021), to using Adobe CF Docker images, the AWS or Azure AMI's, and more. But for our purposes, the option we recommend and will focus on is by way of setting up and using CommandBox, from Ortus Solutions.

## About CommandBox

CommandBox is a standalone, native tool for Windows, Mac, and Linux that will provide you with a embedded CFML server (it's able to support ColdFusion, Lucee, or BoxLang), as well as an interactive Command Line Interface (CLI) which provides developer productivity, tool interaction, package management, application scaffolding, and more.

The following steps discuss briefly the process of installing CommandBox, its initial setup, launching your web site, and then stopping your site and CommandBox. If you have any difficulty with CommandBox, there's a wonderfully helpful community available at https://community.ortussolutions.com/ or via the #box-products channel on the [CFML Slack](https://cfml.slack.com/).

## Installing CommandBox

To install CommandBox on Windows, follow the steps below:

1. Open up a browser and go to: <https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox>
2. Download the CommandBox install option for "Windows JRE-64"
3. Find the downloaded zip which should be in your downloads folder (C:\Users\username\Downloads\)
4. Unzip the zip file into the downloads folder (commandbox-jre-win64-6.2.1.zip)
5. Make a shortcut on your desktop to box.exe
   1. right click on the box.exe, click Send To and select Desktop (create shortcut) 
6. Once unzipped, double click on the box.exe to install -- the command prompt will appear and run through the setup

For Mac and Linux, see the download and install documentation at the CommandBox site: https://commandbox.ortusbooks.com/setup/installation, which covers using HomeBrew and Apt Install, respectively. Then return to continue with the following steps.

## Setting Up CommandBox
After installing and running CommandBox, at your command prompt run the following command to implement the CommandBox bullet train module, which provides helpful additional information within the CommandBox CLI: `box install commandbox-bullet-train`

(If you have entered the box command and are running within the interactive CommandBox CLI, you can leave off the word "box" on this and other CommandBox commands.)

If your version of CommandBox is older than 5.8 (March 2023), run also the following command to implement the cfconfig module (included in 5.8 and above), which helps manage CF admin settings: `box install commandbox-cfconfig`
 
## Launching your site with CommandBox
CommandBox is now setup and ready to use. To use CommandBox to spin up a ColdFusion server to run a site, do the following:
   1.  CD into your site location (ex: cd c:/myCodeExample/site1)
   2.  Run `box server start cfengine=adobe@2018`
           a. This will run through the download and installation of Adobe ColdFusion 2018 (while the content and example code for Learn CF In a Week should work fine on later CF versions, such testing has not yet been undertaken)
   3.  When the initial download and setup of ColdFusion is complete, your site will open up in your default browser

You can now proceed to edit code in your site directory and run it in your browser.

## Shutting down your CommandBox-implemented site
1.  If you have a site running, you can shut it down when you're finished working with it
    1.  To shut down the site, run: `box server stop --all`
2.  To close the CommandBox prompt, either type `exit` or just close the command prompt window by clicking the x in the top right corner.

Note also that CommandBox will also add an icon to your system tray, allowing you to start/stop your CF server, open the CF Admin, and more. For more information on CommandBox, see its documentation at https://commandbox.ortusbooks.com/.
