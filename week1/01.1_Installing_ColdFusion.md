To be able to program in ColdFusion, a ColdFusion server needs to be
installed. There are a couple of options available, but the one that we
are going to focus on is setting up and using CommandBox by Ortus Solutions.

CommandBox is a standalone, native tool for Windows, Mac, and Linux that will provide you with a embedded CFML server, Command Line Interface (CLI) for developer productivity, tool interaction, package management,  application scaffolding, and more.
