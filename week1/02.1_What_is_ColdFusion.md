ColdFusion is a rapid development platform for building modern web
applications. ColdFusion is designed to be expressive and powerful. The
expressive characteristic allows you to perform programming tasks at a
higher level than most other languages. The powerful characteristic
gives you integration with functionality important to web applications
like database access, MS Exchange access, PDF form creation and more.

The ColdFusion platform is built on Java and uses the Apache Tomcat J2EE
container. While you have full access to Java and Tomcat, you need not
worry about these details. You'll interact with ColdFusion and the user
friendly ColdFusion Mark-up Language (CFML) to write your programs. Your
ColdFusion files will use the file extension '.cfc' for objects and
'.cfm' for pages. CFML requires much less ceremony and infrastructure
than typical java while offering a significantly faster development
experience than Java.

After taking this CF in a Week series, you'll have the basics necessary
to begin making dynamic web sites, building intranet applications, or
even working on the next Facebook competitor!
