The ARTISTS table in the cfartgallery datasource used for examples is an
excellent example of how **NOT** to store passwords. First, they are
stored in clear text and the column is limited to only 8 characters.

| ARTISTID   | EMAIL               | THEPASSWORD
| ---------- | ------------------- | -------------
|  4         | user@demodata.com   | demo
|  10        | diane@demo.com      | demo
|  15        | me@m.com            | admin

The next step most people take is to hash the password and store the
hash in the database (assuming we increase the length of THEPASSWORD to
accommodate it). Hashing provides a one way encoding of a string to a
fixed length string. Below shows what the table would look like if
THEPASSWORD for each user was hashed using MD5.

```cfml
<cfscript>
    variables.hashedPassword = Hash( form.password );
</cfscript>
```

| ARTISTID  | EMAIL             |  THEPASSWORD
| --------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------
|  4        |  user@demodata.com|   FE01CE2A7FBAC8FAFAED7C982A04E229
|  10       |  diane@demo.com    |  FE01CE2A7FBAC8FAFAED7C982A04E229
|  15       |  me@m.com          |  21232F297A57A5A743894A0E4A801FC3

What you'll notice is that the hashed password for both
`user@demodata.com` and `diane@demo.com` are still the same. This makes it
easier for the attacker to compromise multiple accounts because the
input password is the same for both accounts. To make the hashes unique
for each user, we need to generate a string to be appended to the
password, or a salt. The salt needs to be unique and randomly generated
for each user. Both the salt and the hashed password need to be stored
in the database. Also, change the hashing algorithm to SHA-512, because
both MD5 and SHA-1 are vulnerable to collision attacks.

```cfml
<cfscript>
    variables.salt = Hash( GenerateSecretKey( "AES" ), "SHA-512" );
    //could use Rand("SHA1PRNG") instead of GenerateSecretKey()

    variables.hashedPassword = Hash( form.password & variables.salt, "SHA-512" );
    //insert both variables.salt and variables.hashedPassword into table
</cfscript>
```

| ARTISTID  | EMAIL             |  THEPASSWORD         |   THESALT
| --------- | ----------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------
|  4        |  user@demodata.com|   457AEB091B4F87EB5D... |     1BF869C286A1D2A4B0...
|  10       |  diane@demo.com   |   2F275B973C5D617F56... |     0EDCEE1F72ABD928B1
|  15       |  me@m.com         |   ED0148FBC717B9F121... |   C8FE4F050FFE75F6FA

As you can see, THEPASSWORD for all the users is unique because they
have been salted.

ColdFusion 10 enhanced Hash() by adding an additional parameter to
provide the number of iterations the Hash should be run.

```cfml
<cfset variables.numIterarions = 1000>

<cfquery name="request.getPwdAndSalt" datasource="cfartgallery">
    SELECT  THEPASSWORD, SALT
    FROM    ARTISTS
    WHERE   EMAIL = <cfqueryparam cfsqltype="cf_sql_varchar" value="#form.user#" maxlength="50">
</cfquery>

<cfif request.getPwdAndSalt.RecordCount EQ 1>
    <cfif request.getPwdAndSalt.THEPASSWORD EQ Hash(form.password & request.getPwdAndSalt.SALT, "SHA-512", "utf-8", variables.numIterarions)>
        <cfset SessionRotate()>
        <!--- Password is good --->
    <cfelse>
        <!--- Bad Password --->
    </cfif>
<cfelse>
    <!--- Bad User --->
</cfif>
```

## Using PBKDF instead of Hash

ColdFusion 11 added a function called [generatePBKDFKey()](https://helpx.adobe.com/coldfusion/cfml-reference/coldfusion-functions/functions-e-g/generatepbkdfkey.html) which provides for a stronger one way function implementation than the `hash()` function.

Here is an example of generating a password _hash_ using `generatePBKDFKey`:

```cfml
<cfscript>
    variables.hashedPassword = generatePBKDFKey( "PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1", form.password, variables.salt, 10000, 128 );
</cfscript>
```
