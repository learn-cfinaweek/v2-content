Now that you have finished Learn CF in a Week, you should have a good understanding of ColdFusion. While you might not be ready to go out and lead a team of developers in building a highly complex and scalable application, you should feel confident enough in creating a few basic applications while you get your feet wet.

With the completion of this course, you are probably wondering what you should do next. There are a few things that you can do to help improve your ColdFusion knowledge:

## Read Articles and Blogs

There are many articles and blog posts published on a regular basis that will help you advance your knowledge. Often, these resources will be on specific ColdFusion functionality or development problems that you might come across while you are developing. These resources are jam packed with information from developers who have come across the problem and found a good solution. Here are a few useful resources:

- **Adobe ColdFusion Community Portal:** [https://coldfusion.adobe.com/](https://coldfusion.adobe.com/)\

## Attend Conferences

There are a number of conferences throughout the year that offer presentations on ColdFusion topics. These conferences provide an opportunity to attend a wide variety of presentations on numerous topics, some which you might have experience with and some you might never have come across before. These conferences give you the chance to broaden your knowledge and directly interact with the speakers. Also, you will meet and socialize with other ColdFusion developers. It is not uncommon for people to leave a conference filled with new ideas that they wish to try out.

Always keep your eyes and ears open for new conferences that might start up, but for now, here is a list of established conferences that are held each year:

- **ColdFusion Summit:** [https://cfsummit.adobeevents.com/](https://cfsummit.adobeevents.com/) \
ColdFusion Summit is a two day ColdFusion conference in Las Vegas, Nevada in October or November. The conference is offered by Adobe, and has a number of beginner to intermediate level ColdFusion topics as well as presentations by Adobe ColdFusion development engineers. It is attended by many of the leading ColdFusion community members and is packed with great information. There is typically a pre-conference workshop day, with in-depth hands-on sessions on topics such as security or containerization. Adobe also offers a one day ColdFusion Summit East conference in the Washington, DC area in April.
- **Into The Box:** [https://www.intothebox.org/](https://www.intothebox.org/) \
Into The Box is a 2 day conference in The Woodlands, Texas (not far from Houston) in May. The conference is offered by Ortus Solutions (famous for the ColdBox framework ecosystem).

CF Camp is a European ColdFusion conference. The conference is held in Munich, Germany in October. The conference provides general training for both beginner and advanced level CFML programmers.

## Listen to Podcasts

Podcasts are a great way to learn what is going on in the ColdFusion
world as you get to listen to them at your own leisure. Maybe it is when
you are on your commute into work, or maybe when you are hitting the
gym. Whenever it is, podcasts are packed with lots of information about
what is going on in the ColdFusion community, any new information that
Adobe has released about the next version of ColdFusion, and interviews
with members of the ColdFusion community.

Here are a few of the current ColdFusion podcasts:

- **Modernize or Die - CFML News Edition:** [https://cfmlnews.modernizeordie.io/](https://cfmlnews.modernizeordie.io/) \

Each episode is also available in video form on YouTube.

## Get Certified

Besides building some fantastic applications, one way to demonstrate to people how great your ColdFusion knowledge is to get ColdFusion Certified. Beginning in 2019, Adobe is offering a Certified ColdFusion Specialist course and exam during the pre-conference day at CF Summit (and plans to offer it at CF Summit East in 2020).
