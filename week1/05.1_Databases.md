One of the key parts of any application is its ability to do CRUD
(Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations. ColdFusion has the
ability to read a variety of data sources with minimal effort; there is
built in support for over ten different databases. Among the supported
databases, you will find MS SQL, MySql, Oracle, DB2, and Sybase. There
are slight sql syntax differences when interacting with the database;
however, the same code can be used against different databases without
any changes.

## Query Basics

A data source needs to be configured in the administrator. The data
source contains all the connection information that ColdFusion needs to
communicate with your database. Rather than providing all that
information with each database call, ColdFusion allows you to defined a
data source, providing it a name, and use the name as a reference for
all your queries.

If you installed the samples when you installed ColdFusion, then there
are some for you to play with already. Once you have the datasource
created, you can start to do CRUD operations.

### Creating a Data Source:

1. Login to ColdFusion Administrator.
1. On the left menu under "Data & Services," select "Data Sources".
1. Under "Add New Data Source", enter a name (this will be the name you
    will use in your code to reference the data source) and select a
    driver type. The type must match the database type you are using.
1. Click "Add" to submit the form.
1. The next screen will vary depending on data source type. The
    following steps are based on selecting "MySQL (4/5)" as a type.
1. Enter database name (name of your database on your server).
1. Enter Server (IP address or domain name of server).
1. Port is defaulted but change it if necessary.
1. Enter username (this is the login that will be tied to all database actions from your application).
1. Enter Password.
1. Enter a description if necessary.
1. This is not a requirement, but you can click on "Advanced Settings" and make any adjustments there.
1. Click "Submit" to save.
1. The data source will validate; if there are any errors they will be reported on screen.
1. If necessary, correct any errors until the data source validates upon save.

### Basic Query

```cfml
// script
<cfscript>
    myquery = QueryExecute('SELECT * FROM artists', [], {datasource = 'cfartgallery'});
</cfscript>

// tags
<cfquery name="myQuery" datasource="cfartgallery">
    SELECT * FROM artists
</cfquery>
```

The query result is stored in the variable with the same name as they
query name. To see the result of the query, you can just dump the
result.

```cfml
<cfdump var="#myQuery#">
```

The dump will contain information on caching status, execution time,
actual sql statement, and the entire result set. Don't let the dump
confuse you; the result is not stored in a "resultset" variable. That is
just how cfdump shows it.

There is other information about the query that cfdump does not display
that are part of the myquery object, such as columnlist and recordcount.
These can be referenced by using myquery.columnlist or
myquery.recordcount.

> **Performance Tip:** The query should only return the columns you need;
> this speeds up the query and return processing. For example, since the output
> in the above example only used email, firstname, and lastname, the query
> should be changed from "select \*" to "select email, firstname, and lastname".

## Query Output

While cfdump is a great way to make sure the query is working, it isn't
very useful output to a user. Using cfoutput, we now gain display
control and can display what we want how we want it.

```cfml
<cfoutput query="myQuery">
    #myquery.CurrentRow# - #myquery.email# - #myquery.firstname# - #myquery.lastname#<br>
</cfoutput>
```

There are times where you may wish to process the query return but not
directly output it. To accomplish this, use cfloop. This tag allows you
to loop over the result set and perform operations per row (and output
them too). It is also useful in the event that you wish to loop over a
query result and there is already an outer cfoutput in the code. The
syntax looks identical to cfoutput.

```cfml
<cfset artistArray = []>
<cfloop query="myQuery">
    <cfset arrayappend(artistArray, myquery.lastname & ', ' & myQuery.firstname)>
</cfloop>
```

### Query Output Grouping

It is also possible to nest cfoutput tags so you can group like data.
This creates a nested loop where the outer loop is iterated once per
group and the inner is looped once for each item in the group. While
this sounds great on the surface, it does have a drawback: the data must
be pre-sorted before the cfoutput for the grouping to work correctly. In
the example below, an order by is added to the query, which makes sure
that the rows come back in the correct order. The cfoutput tag now has a
group attribute. The value of this attribute must always be a column
name of the query. Inside the cfoutput is another cfoutput. This is the
inner loop that will output once per row in the group. The outer will
only output once.

```cfml
<cfset myquery = QueryExecute(' SELECT * FROM art ORDER BY issold', [], {datasource = 'cfartgallery'})>

<cfoutput Query="myQuery" group="issold">
    <p>
        Sold ?: #YesNoFormat(myQuery.issold)#:<br>
        <blockquote>
            <cfoutput>
                #myQuery.artname#: #DollarFormat(myQuery.price)#<br>
            </cfoutput>
        </blockquote>
    </p>
    <hr>
</cfoutput>
```

## Query Param

One of the biggest attacks against a system is sql injection. However,
an easy way to prevent it is to use cfqueryparam. This sets parameters
for the query input, thus making injection nearly impossible.
cfqueryparam should be used anywhere you have query input. cfqueryparam
is not exclusive to select where clauses; it should also be used for
inserts, updates, or any query that has dynamic input.

cfqueryparam is also useful in doing data length validation as well as
data type. For example, if your query param is set as an integer and a
string is passed, an error will be thrown. The same is true when a
string is longer than the set max length.

> **Note: parameters should be used ALWAYS without exception.**

Query Example:

```cfml
// script
<cfscript>
    myquery = QueryExecute ("select * from Artists where firstname=?", ["#form.name#"], {datasource="cfartgallery"});;
</cfscript>

// tags
<cfquery name="myQuery" datasource="cfartgallery">
    SELECT * FROM artists
    WHERE firstname = <cfqueryparam value="#form.name#" cfsqltype="cf_sql_varchar">
</cfquery>
```

If you have debugging enabled, the query output in the debug info will
look a little different:

```
myQuery (Datasource=cfartgallery, Time=1ms, Records=1) i

    SELECT * FROM artists
    WHERE firstname = ?

Query Parameter Value(s) -
Parameter #1(cf_sql_varchar) = Austin
```

Notice the "?" in the where clause? That is the parameter that was
created using cfqueryparam. You can also use it to replace a list in an
"in" clause:

```cfml
// script
<cfscript>
    myquery = QueryExecute ("SELECT * FROM artists WHERE artistid IN (:ids)", {ids={value='#form.ids#',list=true}}, {datasource="cfartgallery"});
</cfscript>

// tags
<cfquery name="myQuery" datasource="cfartgallery">
    SELECT * FROM artists
    WHERE artistid IN (<cfqueryparam value="#form.ids#" list="true">)
</cfquery>


myQuery (Datasource=cfartgallery, Time=2ms, Records=4) i
select * from ARTISTS
where artistid in (?,?,?,?)
Query Parameter Value(s) -
Parameter #1(CF_SQL_CHAR) = 1
Parameter #2(CF_SQL_CHAR) = 2
Parameter #3(CF_SQL_CHAR) = 3
Parameter #4(CF_SQL_CHAR) = 4
```

## Query Caching

Query caching is very easy to implement. Caching will be covered in
detail in a later chapter; for now, this chapter will just touch on one
way to cache here: cachedwithin. This type of cache states that the
query result will be stored and reused for the specified duration. Using
the previous query example, caching the result can be done like this:

```cfml
// script
<cfscript>
    myquery = QueryExecute(' SELECT * FROM artists', [], {datasource = 'cfartgallery', cachedwithin='#createTimespan(0,1,0,0)#'});
</cfscript>

// tags
<cfquery name="myQuery" datasource="cfartgallery" cachedwithin="#createTimespan(0,1,0,0)#">
    SELECT * FROM artists
</cfquery>
```

This would cause the query result to cache for 1 hour. Caching is based
on the query syntax, not the query name. As long as the syntax doesn't
change, the cache will be used. However, if you have a very dynamic
query, caching can be a challenge. For example, if the below is your
query, you might not want to cache it because the sql syntax can vary
widely from request to request. Using cfqueryparam does not help in
caching at the ColdFusion server level. However, it does assist with
database query plans so there is some caching benefit.

```cfml
// script
<cfscript>
    myquery = QueryExecute ("select firstname, lastname, email from Artists where firstname=?", ["#form.name#"],  {datasource = 'cfartgallery', cachedwithin='#createTimespan(0,1,0,0)#'});
</cfscript>

// tags
<cfquery name="myQuery" datasource="cfartgallery" cachedwithin="#createTimespan(0,1,0,0)#">
    SELECT firstname, lastname, email FROM artists
    WHERE firstname = <cfqueryparam value="#form.firstname#" cfsqltype="cf_sql_varchar">
</cfquery>
```

## Dynamic Queries

Queries are not always straightforward. There may be occurrences in
which a where clause or column list needs to be decided upon at runtime.
Thankfully, cfquery allows for wide range of dynamics to create the
query. Think of it like generating browser output without any markup or
cfoutput tags, like a paragraph of text. Knowing that, we can use a
variety of ways to generate a dynamic query.

### cftags inside cfquery

```cfml
// script
<cfscript>
    qryString = 'SELECT firstname, lastname, email FROM artists WHERE 1 = 1'>

    if (structkeyExists(form, 'firstname') and len(form.firstname)) {
        qryString = qryString & ' AND firstname = #form.firstname#';
    }

    if ( structkeyExists(form, 'lastname') and len(form.lastname)){
        qryString = qryString & ' AND lastname = #form.lastname#';
    }

    myquery = QueryExecute(qryString, [],  {datasource = 'cfartgallery'});
</cfscript>

// tags
<cfquery name="myQuery" datasource="cfartgallery">
    SELECT firstname, lastname, email FROM artists
    WHERE 1 = 1
     <cfif structkeyExists(form, 'firstname') and len(form.firstname)>
        AND firstname = <cfqueryparam value="#form.firstname#" cfsqltype="cf_sql_varchar">
    </cfif>
    <cfif structkeyExists(form, 'lastname') and len(form.lastname)>
        AND lastname = <cfqueryparam value="#form.lastname#" cfsqltype="cf_sql_varchar">
    </cfif>
</cfquery>
```

## Limiting Result Counts

Returning thousands of rows from a query can be very inefficient. It is
good practice to only return the number of rows you are going to deal
with. Reducing the result set to a defined number of rows can be done in
a variety of ways: You could add a maxrows to the output; you could add
a max count to the sql statement itself; or you could add a max to the
cfquery tag itself. These are all valid ways to handle it, but choosing
which way to handle the result can be a challenge. Adding a limiter to
the cfquery tag or in the sql statement limits the rows from the
databases, but the max rows on the output just reduces the output. Thus,
if you query returned 10,000 rows, your output could have a max of 100,
and only display the first 100.

```cfml
<cfoutput query="myQuery" maxrows="100">
    #myquery.CurrentRow# - #myquery.email# - #myquery.firstname# - #myquery.lastname#<br>
</cfoutput>
```

The issue is that there were 9,900 rows of ignored data. The better
approach may be to have the database only return 100 rows, which can be
done by setting a max on the initial query.

```cfml
// script
<cfscript>
    myquery = QueryExecute('SELECT firstname, lastname, email FROM artists', [], {datasource = 'cfartgallery', maxrows='100'});
</cfscript>

// tags
<cfquery name="myQuery" datasource="cfartgallery" maxrows="100">
    SELECT firstname, lastname, email FROM artists
</cfquery>
```

This way is much more efficient, as less data is transmitted from
database to server. It also helps speed things up as ColdFusion no
longer has to deal with query data that is not being used.

## Insert and Identity Retrieval

When inserting records, you are going to want to know the ID of the
inserted item more often than not. Typically, this is achieved by doing
the insert, then doing a select and getting the highest ID in the table.
While this may work, it is very problematic and may not yield the
expected results. Fortunately, there is an alternative that works very
well and yields the correct results. Look at the example below:

```cfml
// script
<cfscript>
    QueryExecute(
        'INSERT INTO art ( artistsID, artName, description, isSold, largeImage, mediaID, price ) VALUES ( ?,?,?,?,?,?,? )',
        [ 1, 'test item', 'test desc', 1, 'img.png', 1, 1 ],
        { datasource = 'cfartgallery', result="qryResult" }
    );
</cfscript>

// tags
<cfquery result="qryResult" datasource="cfartgallery">
    INSERT INTO art
    (
        artistsID, artName, description, isSold, largeImage, mediaID, price
    )
    VALUES
    (
        <cfqueryparam cfsqltype="CF_SQL_INTEGER" value="1">,
        <cfqueryparam cfsqltype="CF_SQL_VARCHAR" value="Test Item">,
        <cfqueryparam cfsqltype="CF_SQL_VARCHAR" value="Test Desc">,
        <cfqueryparam cfsqltype="CF_SQL_INTEGER" value="1">,
        <cfqueryparam cfsqltype="CF_SQL_VARCHAR" value="img.png">,
        <cfqueryparam cfsqltype="CF_SQL_INTEGER" value="1">,
        <cfqueryparam cfsqltype="CF_SQL_INTEGER" value="1">
    )
</cfquery>

<cfdump var="#qryResult#">
```

Notice in the above a result attribute was added and given a value of
"qryResult." This variable is a structure of data that can be dumped. One of the
parts of the data is the ID of the inserted row. It will also contain
the params (if any), execution time, and the sql statement. Depending on
your database, the identity variable may be different; dump the result
first to see what the column is.
