As well as having the ability to read about ColdFusion, 'Learn CF in a
Week' has a Hands On section of the course, giving you the opportunity
to create your own ColdFusion web site. During the course, you will take
a basic HTML website and add ColdFusion to it, creating a fully
functional ColdFusion application.

To be able to take part in the Hands On, you must first install the
necessary Application files. To do this, follow the steps below:

> **Note:** before running this, you should have installed ColdFusion and MariaDB.

## Windows

1. create learnCFinaweek folder (example: c:\inetpub\wwwroot\learncfinaweek)
1. go out to github and go to this site:
1. grab the zip file from here or do a git clone. Check upper right corner for Clone/Zip.
1. unzip the code into this folder you just created or git clone into this folder.
1. The code has now been loaded onto your machine.
1. you should have already created the database and installed commandBox to run .
1. if the site code is not installed, follow the instructions on the install  site
1. Click on the commandBox box.exe file to start commandBox.
   1. type cd path to folder (c:\inetpub\wwwroot\learncfinaweek)
   1. type in server start cfengine=adobe@2018
   1. this command will run commandBox and load up your site.
1. you will see your site in the address bar of the browser (example: http://localhost:portNbr). Now add install/insertDBdata.cfm to the url  (http://localhost:portNbr/install/insertDBData.cfm)
1. this will bring up the create database and insert data page.
1. coldfusion admin password: commandbox
1. mariadb password: you created it --- admin
1. mariadb location: localhost (default)
1. mariadb port: 3306 (default)
1. once this information is added to this install page, click the submit button to run the database creation scripts.
1. If all things work correctly, a message page will appear all green circles and everything created.
1. you should now be able to got to the first chapter in the site and the site should appear.
1. url: http://localhost:portnbr/www/
1. If any problems occur, follow the onscreen instructions on how tocorrect them. If no problems exist, you are good to start the course.

## Mac

1. Download the sample application files from the download link in the header.
1. Create a folder in your web root called 'learncfinaweek'. Your webroot is located at: /Applications/ColdFusion10/cfusion/wwwroot/
1. Unzip the sample application files into the learncfinaweek folder. The contents of the folder should look like this: \![](/assets/img/mac_folder_structure_small.png)
1. To confirm you have the files in the correct place, go to: <http://localhost:8500/learncfinaweek/>.
1. Now that you have the files in the correct place, you now need to run an install script that will populate your database and set up ColdFUsion with the necessary information. Go to: <http://localhost/learncfinaweek/install/>.
1. Fill out the form using the passwords from the previous installation processes and click on "Install".
1. If any problems occur, follow the onscreen instructions on how to correct them. If no problems exist, you are good to start the course.

## How the Hands on Work

Throughout this course you will see a number of hands on pages. These
pages give you step by step instructions on what to do to your
ColdFusion code. The root of the project is located at:
C:\\path_where_this_folder_was_created\\learncfinaweek\\www\\ for Windows
and /path_where_this_folder_was_created/learncfinaweek/www/ for
Macs.

Inside the 'learncfinaweek' folder, you will see a number of folders
that relate to the chapters, such as chapter1Solution, chapter2Solution,
and so on. Inside these folders, you will find copies of the code which
have all the hands ons completed up until and including that chapter. If
at any point you get stuck with a code problem, you can look at these
files to see what the solution is. If you are still unable to find what
is causing the problem in your code, you can copy the files and folders
from the chapter folder and place them in your 'www' folder. Once you
have copied them in, you can continue with the next chapter..

Once you have completed the hands on problems, you will have a fully
functioning ColdFusion web site that is ready to be launched right away.
Included in this application is file manipulation, database calls,
remote calls, sending emails, ORM, and a fully secured Admin area.
