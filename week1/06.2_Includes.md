You can also make a new `.cfm` file and use it as a function library. You
can then use the `cfinclude` tag to include it on any pages that might
need it.

`cfinclude` accepts two attributes:

* `template` - The logical path to the ColdFusion file to include
* `runOnce` - An optional boolean value, defaulting to `false`. If set to `true` the given template will not be processed again for a given request if it has already been processed.

If the function is placed in a file called
`greetingCustomizer.cfm`, to give our page access to the function we just
include our greeting customizer on the page like so:

```cfml
<cfinclude template="path/to/libraries/greetingCustomizer.cfm">
```

The rest of the page remains unchanged. What it actually does is treat
the code that is in the included file as if it were on the page itself.
Doing so grants the included template access to all of the variables on
the including page. On the surface, it might seem like a good idea, but
we will get into why it can actually make code very messy in a little
while. In the meantime, once we've included `greetingCustomizer.cfm` on
our page, it will look like this:

```cfml
<cfinclude template="path/to/libraries/greetingCustomizer.cfm">

<cfset fullName = getFullName( firstName="Matt", lastName="Gifford" )>

<cfoutput>
    Hello, #fullName#!
</cfoutput>
```

The same can be achieved using the script syntax:

``` {.prettyprint}
<cfscript>
include "path/to/libraries/greetingCustomizer.cfm";

fullName = getFullName( firstName="Matt", lastName="Gifford" );

writeOutput( fullName );
</cfscript>
```

While `cfinclude` is an extremely simple approach, it does have some
drawbacks. As mentioned above, the included file now has access to every
variable on the including page, creating the possibility of introducing
unnecessary dependencies between the two files. For example, with
`cfinclude`, declaring arguments isn't really necessary with the function
if the values already exist on the page, and less experienced developers
might be tempted to leave them out altogether.

displayPage.cfm:

```cfml
<cfset firstName = "Matt">
<cfset lastName  = "Gifford">

<cfinclude template="path/to/libraries/greetingCustomizer.cfm">

<cfset fullName = getFullName()>

<cfoutput>
    Hello, #fullName#!
</cfoutput>
```

greetingCustomizer.cfm:

```cfml
<cffunction name="getFullName" output="false" access="public" returnType="string">
    <cfset var fullName = firstName & " " & lastName>
    <cfreturn fullName>
</cffunction>
```

Remember that `cfinclude` embeds the CFML code in `greetingCustomizer.cfm`
into `displayPage.cfm`, so writing our code this way is perfectly valid.
Unfortunately, it opens the door to a lot of confusion. A developer
looking at the function by itself has no idea where the `firstName` and
`lastName` variables came from. If this function is used anywhere else,
those variables will need to be declared on the page or passed into the
function. What was done in the example above introduced a dependency;
our function no longer stands on its own as an encapsulated block of
code. Instead, it can only work in the context of the including page,
and the benefits of code reuse are lost. It is very important, then, to
make sure that we follow the first example, in which arguments are
declared and use the arguments scope to communicate what the function
needs to our fellow developers.
