The previous sections focused on secure ColdFusion coding practices, but
if the installation of ColdFusion is configured insecurely, all of that
work is for nothing. Securing the ColdFusion Application Server requires
making the OS, web server, and the ColdFusion configuration secure.  Adobe has published Lockdown Guides for each version of ColdFusion:

## Commercial ColdFusion Security Tools

- [Fixinator ColdFusion Code Security Scanner](https://fixinator.app/) - scans your source code and alerts you to vulnerabilities.
- [FuseGuard Web Application Firewall for CFML](https://foundeo.com/security/fuseguard/) - runs inside your CFML application to log or block potentially malicious requests.
- [HackMyCF CF Server Security Scanner](https://foundeo.com/hack-my-cf/) - Scans your CF server on an automated basis to look for missing hotfixes or security misconfigurations.

## Sandboxing

ColdFusion has had security sandboxing for quite a long time, but is
probably an under utilized option that can help secure ColdFusion
because it is only really useful in Enterprise. Sandboxing allows you to
restrict access to data sources, ColdFusion tags/functions, directories,
and servers/ports on a subdirectory. If a piece of ColdFusion code tries
to access a restricted resource in the sandbox, ColdFusion will throw an
error. The best use of sandboxing is to restrict everything on the
webroot of a server and then only allow what is needed per the
subdirectory (web application).
